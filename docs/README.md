# Underscore Protocol: One Wallet. Every Protocol. Total Control.

Your crypto is trapped in a basic wallet that can't do anything. You juggle 10 different DeFi apps. You miss yield opportunities while sleeping. You pay excessive gas from inefficiency. And one wrong click could drain everything.

Underscore changes all of this. Your wallet becomes an intelligent financial operating system — connecting to every protocol, automating complex strategies, maintaining total security. Finally, a wallet that works as hard as you do.

***

## The Problem: Today's Wallets Are Just Expensive Storage

**Basic Wallets** (MetaMask, Rainbow)  
Hold assets. Send transactions. That's it. Like having a Ferrari but only using it to listen to the radio.

**DeFi Fragmentation**  
Aave for lending. Uniswap for swaps. Compound for yields. Ten tabs open, none talking to each other. This isn't the future we were promised.

**Manual Everything**  
Claim rewards at 3am. Rebalance positions constantly. Miss opportunities while you sleep. The 24/7 market doesn't care about your schedule.

## The Underscore Solution: Intelligent Financial Automation

## The Magic: How It All Works Together

Your Underscore Wallet isn't just one thing — it's an ecosystem of intelligent features working in harmony.

### Example Day in Your Financial Life

**7 AM**: Your [AI Manager](managers.md) notices Morpho offering 1% better yield than Aave. It automatically rebalances $50,000, saving you gas and capturing extra yield. You're still sleeping.

**10 AM**: Monthly rent is due. Your landlord (configured as [Payee](payees.md)) pulls exactly $2,500 USDC. Not a penny more. Your remaining funds keep earning yield.

**2 PM**: You need to pay a contractor. Create a $5,000 [cheque](cheques.md) with 3-day delay. If they don't deliver, cancel it. Simple.

**4 PM**: Market crash! Move $200,000 to your hardware wallet ([whitelisted](whitelist.md)) instantly. No daily limits blocking emergency moves.

**11 PM**: Check your [rewards](rewards.md). $150 accumulated from protocol fees. Your 10 referred users generated $500 in fees, netting you another $150. Passive income while you lived your life.

## Common Questions

**Is my wallet upgradeable?**  
No. Your wallet code is immutable for security. New features come through Lego integrations.

**What are Legos?**  
Standardized integrations with DeFi protocols. When new protocols launch, your wallet can use them immediately.

**Can I use multiple wallets?**  
Yes. Whitelist them for instant transfers between your wallets.

**What about L2s?**  
Currently Base L2 only. More chains coming.

**How do fees work?**  
Small fees (0.1-0.5% on swaps, 10% on yield profits) fund rewards. You earn back through participation.

## The Real Vision: Financial Sovereignty Through Intelligence

Here's what actually matters: You shouldn't have to choose between security and opportunity. Between automation and control. Between simplicity and power.

Every other wallet makes you pick one. Underscore gives you everything.

Your assets work 24/7 across every protocol. Your security preferences are enforced by code, not trust. Your strategies execute automatically within your exact boundaries. This is what crypto was supposed to enable.

While others debate the future of finance, we built it.

One wallet. Every protocol. Total control.

Welcome to finance that actually works for you.
