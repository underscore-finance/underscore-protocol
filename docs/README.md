# Underscore Protocol: One Wallet. Every Protocol. Total Control.

Ten DeFi tabs open. Constantly verifying URLs to avoid getting drained. Manual token approvals for every protocol, every time. While you sleep, that 15% APY drops to 5%. Another $2,000 in missed yield this month alone. The 24/7 market doesn't care about your schedule.

This isn't DeFi. This is DeFi held back by tools from 2020.

**Underscore** transforms your wallet into an intelligent financial operating system. Connect to 20+ protocols through one interface. Enable AI agents and trusted operators to work within your exact boundaries. Pay vendors automatically while funds earn yield. Move millions between your wallets instantly.

This is what DeFi promised. Your money working as hard as you do.

## The Problem: Today's Wallets Are Just Expensive Storage

**Basic Wallets** (MetaMask, Rainbow)  
Manual approvals for every protocol, every time. No built-in payment scheduling — miss a payment, lose a deal. No delegation capabilities — you're the only one who can act, 24/7. Your $500k sits idle between transactions earning nothing. Like having a Ferrari but only using first gear.

**DeFi Fragmentation**  
Aave for lending. Uniswap for swaps. Compound for yields. Ten tabs open, constantly verifying URLs to avoid phishing sites, none talking to each other. This isn't the future we were promised.

**Manual Everything**  
Wake up to claim rewards before they expire. Check yields hourly to catch rate changes. Rebalance positions one by one, transaction by transaction. That 20% APY spike at 3am? Gone by morning. Another $500 in missed gains because you need sleep.

## The Underscore Solution: Intelligent Financial Automation

Transform your static wallet into a dynamic financial operating system. One that connects to every protocol, enables automated strategies through secure delegation, and maintains institutional-grade security — all through a single interface.

**Unified Protocol Access**: No more tab juggling or phishing risks. Your Underscore wallet connects directly to Aave, Morpho, Uniswap, and 20+ protocols through standardized adapters. Execute complex multi-protocol strategies in single transactions. Your funds work across every protocol without you lifting a finger.

**Intelligent Payment Rails**: Three distinct systems for every payment need. Digital Cheques you can cancel if the contractor doesn't deliver. Payees that pull payments automatically so you never miss payroll. Whitelist for moving millions between your wallets instantly. Your funds earn 5% APY until the second they're needed.

**Secure Delegation**: Let AI agents capture that 15% APY at 3am. Enable your CFO to pay $100k in vendor invoices without touching your $2M reserves. Allow traders to work your portfolio within exact position limits. Every action validated against your rules, revocable with one click.

**Atomic Operations**: Rebalance $500k across five protocols in one transaction. Claim rewards from Aave, swap to USDC, and re-deploy to Morpho — all in 12 seconds. What used to take 30 minutes and 5 transactions now happens instantly.

This isn't incremental improvement. It's a fundamental reimagining of what a wallet can be.

## The Magic: How It All Works Together

Your Underscore Wallet isn't just one thing — it's an ecosystem of intelligent features working in harmony.

### Example Day in Your Financial Life

**7 AM**: Your [AI Manager](managers.md) notices Morpho offering 1% better yield than Aave. It automatically rebalances $50,000, capturing extra yield while you sleep.

**10 AM**: Monthly rent is due. Your landlord (configured as [Payee](payees.md)) pulls exactly $2,500 USDC. Not a penny more. Your remaining funds keep earning yield.

**2 PM**: You need to pay a contractor. Create a $5,000 [cheque](cheques.md) with 3-day delay. If they don't deliver, cancel it. Simple.

**4 PM**: Time to fund your aggressive trading wallet. Move $200,000 to your other Underscore wallet ([whitelisted](whitelist.md)) instantly. Your AI agent spots an arbitrage opportunity.

**11 PM**: Your portfolio rebalanced 3 times today across 5 protocols. You didn't lift a finger. Total additional yield captured: $247.

## Common Questions

**Is my wallet upgradeable?**  
No. Your wallet code is immutable for security. New features come through Lego integrations.

**What are Legos?**  
Standardized integrations with DeFi protocols. When new protocols launch, your wallet can use them immediately.

**Can I use multiple wallets?**  
Yes. Whitelist them for instant transfers between your wallets.

**What about L2s?**  
Currently Base L2 only. More chains coming.

**How do fees work?**  
Small fees on swaps (0.25%), yield profits (10%), and external reward claims (10%). No fees on transfers, deposits, or idle funds. Up to 50% of fees go to ambassadors and users through revenue sharing.

## The Future of Financial Operations

Remember those 10 tabs you had open, constantly checking URLs? The yield opportunities you missed at 3am? The manual approvals, one by one, for every protocol?

That's not DeFi. That's DeFi handicapped by tools from 2020.

Underscore delivers what crypto promised: programmable money that works as hard as you do. Your funds earning across protocols while maintaining liquidity for payments. Your trusted operators executing strategies within unbreakable boundaries. Your security protecting without restricting.

This isn't about choosing the lesser evil. It's about having everything — automation and control, security and accessibility, simplicity and power.

One wallet. Every protocol. Total control.

Stop managing wallets. Start managing wealth.
