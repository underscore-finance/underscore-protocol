# Managers: The Autonomous Operators of Your Underscore Wallet

You've been doing DeFi wrong. Manually claiming rewards at 3am. Missing arbitrage opportunities while you sleep. Watching yields evaporate because you couldn't rebalance fast enough.

Enter **Managers** — the game-changing delegation system that lets your wallet work as hard as you do. Grant specific permissions to trusted operators, AI agents, or professional services. Set unbreakable spending limits enforced by smart contracts. Revoke access instantly if anything seems off.

This isn't your grandfather's power of attorney. This is programmable, revocable, limited delegation that puts you in complete control while enabling 24/7 optimization.

## Core Concept: Delegation Without Trust

Traditional finance forces an impossible choice: keep full control and miss opportunities, or hand over your keys and pray. Underscore Managers create a third option:

```
Traditional:   Give someone your credit card → Hope they don't max it out
Underscore:    Give someone a virtual card → Hard-coded $1,000 limit → Auto-expires in 30 days
```

### Who Can Be a Manager?

**Human Operators**

- Family members with emergency access
- Business partners handling operations
- Team members paying approved vendors
- Professional traders executing strategies

**AI Agents**

- Yield optimization bots working 24/7
- Rebalancing algorithms maintaining portfolios
- DCA bots executing regular purchases
- Arbitrage hunters capturing opportunities

**Professional Services**

- Registered financial advisors
- Institutional trading desks
- Yield aggregator protocols
- Automated market makers

### The Two-Phase Security Model

Every Manager action passes through two validation phases, ensuring comprehensive protection. Behind the scenes, configurations are validated through three layers: HighCommand → UserWalletConfig → Sentinel, guaranteeing enforcement at runtime:

```
Phase 1: Pre-Action Validation        Phase 2: Post-Action Validation
├─ Manager active?                    ├─ Under per-tx USD limit?
├─ Action permitted?                  ├─ Under period USD limit?
├─ Asset allowed?                     ├─ Under lifetime USD limit?
├─ Protocol allowed?                  └─ Update tracking data
└─ Cooldown passed?
```

Both phases execute atomically within the transaction — if any check fails, the entire action reverts.

### Global vs Specific Settings

Underscore employs a dual-layer configuration system where the most restrictive settings always apply:

**Global Manager Settings**

- Master template for all managers in your wallet
- Sets maximum boundaries no manager can exceed
- Includes `canOwnerManage` flag determining if you're subject to limits

**Specific Manager Settings**

- Individual configuration per manager
- Can be more restrictive than global, never less
- Both global AND specific permissions must allow an action

```
Example: Permission Hierarchy
Global: Can trade = Yes, Max per tx = $100k
Manager A: Can trade = Yes, Max per tx = $50k → Limited to $50k
Manager B: Can trade = No, Max per tx = $200k → Cannot trade at all
```

## Permissions: What Managers Can Do

### Transfer & Payment Operations

| Permission            | Capability                       | Example Use Case        |

> **📝 Time Units in Underscore**  
> All time-based settings (delays, cooldowns, periods) are stored in blocks, not wall-clock time. On Base L2 with 2-second blocks:
> - 1 hour = 1,800 blocks
> - 1 day = 43,200 blocks  
> - 1 week = 302,400 blocks
> 
> Examples in this guide assume Base's 2-second block time.

## Controls: Security Boundaries

### Financial Limits

**Per-Transaction Limits**

- Maximum USD value for any single transaction
- Example: $5,000 cap prevents large one-time losses

**Period-Based Limits**

- Total USD value allowed within recurring time windows
- Period length set via `managerPeriod` in global settings (e.g., 43,200 blocks = 1 day)
- Periods reset automatically when the current period ends
- Example: $10,000 per day for trading operations

```
Week 1: Use $7k of $10k limit → Week 2: Fresh $10k limit
Unused amounts don't roll over — each period starts clean
```

**Lifetime Limits**

- Cumulative USD cap over Manager's entire tenure
- Example: $500,000 total for year-long AI service

### Operational Controls

**Transaction Cooldown**

- Mandatory waiting period between transactions
- Measured in blocks (e.g., 1,800 blocks = 1 hour on Base)
- Prevents rapid-fire mistakes or attacks

**Asset Restrictions**

- Limit Manager to specific tokens (e.g., only stablecoins)
- Granular control over what can be touched
- Maximum 40 different assets per manager

**Protocol Restrictions (Legos)**

- Restrict to specific DeFi protocols by ID
- Each protocol (["Lego"](user-wallet.md#the-lego-system) = standardized integration, e.g., Aave, Curve) registered in LegoBook
- Example: Only allow Aave and Compound interactions
- Maximum 25 different protocols per manager

**Payee Restrictions**

- Limit transfers to pre-approved addresses only
- Perfect for business operations with known vendors
- Maximum 40 approved [payees](payees.md) per manager

**Fail on Zero Price**

- Safety feature blocking transactions when asset price is $0
- Prevents trading during oracle failures
- Protects against manipulation when prices unavailable

### Time-Based Security

**Activation Delay**

- New Managers wait before permissions activate
- Configurable up to the max delay your wallet was deployed with (typically 2-3 hours)
- Time to verify additions and cancel if suspicious
- Default: 5,000 blocks (about 2 hours 48 minutes on Base)

**Activation Length**

- Set Manager expiration periods
- Auto-revoke after: 30 days (trial), 90 days (quarterly), 365 days (annual)
- No action needed — permissions end automatically

## How to Set Up Your First Manager

### The Journey from Zero to Automated

**1. Choose Your Manager Period**  
Decide how often spending limits reset — daily, weekly, or monthly. This becomes your default for all managers through global settings. Think of it like a credit card billing cycle.

**2. Add Your Manager**  
Provide their address and two key timeframes:
- **Security Delay**: How long to wait before they’re active (up to your wallet's maximum, typically 2-3 hours)
- **Active Period**: How long they can operate (30 days for trials, 90+ days for trusted services)

**3. Set Permissions and Limits**  
Pick what they can do from the permissions menu:
- Which actions (trade, yield, transfer, etc.)
- Which assets they can touch
- Which protocols they can use
- Maximum amounts per transaction, per period, and lifetime

**4. Monitor Performance**  
Check anytime to see:
- How much they’ve spent vs. their limits
- Transaction history and patterns
- Days remaining in their active period

Your wallet provides detailed manager statistics through the dashboard or by querying current usage data.

**5. Adjust or Remove**  
Based on performance:
- Extend their active period if they’re doing well
- Increase limits for proven performers
- Remove instantly if anything seems wrong

### What to Expect

**During Setup**: Small gas fee to configure (similar to approving a token)

**While Active**: Each manager transaction costs normal DeFi gas — no extra overhead

**For Monitoring**: Checking balances and history is free

**If Problems Arise**: Removal is instant and costs minimal gas

## Lifecycle Management

### Manager States

```
Added → Waiting → Active → Expired
  │        │         │        │
  └────────┴─────────┴────────┴─→ Removable anytime
           │         │
           │         └─→ Extendable (resets expiry)
           │
           └─→ Cancellable before activation
```

### Administrative Hierarchy

**You (The Owner)**

- Add, update, remove any Manager
- Modify all settings and limits
- Extend activation periods
- Ultimate control always

**The Manager**

- Can only remove themselves
- Cannot modify permissions
- Cannot add other Managers
- Prevents permission escalation

**Protocol Security (MissionControl)**

- Emergency Manager removal only
- Cannot add or modify
- Last-resort safety net

## Advanced Integration: Professional AI Services

The most powerful Manager implementations come from professional services that provide sophisticated strategies:

### How Professional Services Work

1. **Service Registration**: AI company deploys their AgentWrapper contract
2. **You Add as Manager**: Grant their contract specific permissions
3. **Atomic Execution**: Service executes complex strategies in single transactions
4. **Gas Abstraction**: Many services pay gas fees for you
5. **Performance Tracking**: Real-time reporting and analytics

> **💸 Fee Considerations**  
> Manager transactions still incur:
> - Normal gas fees (paid by transaction sender - you or the service)
> - Protocol fees on swaps/yields (0.1-0.5%)
> - These fees contribute to your rewards
> 
> Professional services may cover gas costs as part of their offering.

### The Starter Agent

New wallets can include a pre-configured "Starter Agent" with:

- **Immediate Activation**: No waiting period (0 block delay)
- **Limited Permissions**: Basic operations to explore features
- **Educational Purpose**: Learn how managers work risk-free
- **Easy Removal**: Delete anytime once comfortable
- **Example**: Demo yield optimizer showing 2-3% APY gains

### Example: Institutional Yield Optimizer

```
Your Setup:
- Portfolio: $250,000 in stablecoins
- Manager: ProfessionalYieldAI
- Permissions: Manage Yield, Claim Rewards
- Limits: $50k/tx, $500k/month
- Allowed Protocols: Aave, Compound, Morpho, Yearn

What Happens:
1. AI monitors 20+ yield sources every block
2. Spots Morpho at 12% vs Aave's 8%
3. Executes: Withdraw Aave → Deposit Morpho (atomic)
4. Auto-harvests and compounds every 8 hours
5. Sends weekly performance reports

Results:
- Base yield: 8% = $20,000/year
- Optimized: 11% = $27,500/year
- Extra profit: $7,500/year
- Your effort: Zero
```

## Security Best Practices

### Start Conservative

- Test new Managers with small limits
- Use short activation periods initially
- Increase limits after proving reliability

### Layer Your Defenses

- Combine multiple restrictions (assets + protocols + payees)
- Use cooldowns to slow potential attacks
- Set period limits well below lifetime limits

### Monitor Actively

- Check Manager activity regularly
- Set up alerts for large transactions
- Review and adjust permissions quarterly

### Emergency Procedures

1. **Immediate**: Call removeManager() — instant revocation
2. **If Unable**: MissionControl can emergency remove
3. **Prevention**: Conservative limits and short activations

## Common Questions

**Can managers add other managers?**
No. Only the wallet owner can add new managers. This prevents permission escalation attacks.

**What happens when a manager expires?**
They automatically lose all permissions. No action needed from you.

**Can I change limits without removing the manager?**
Yes. Use updateManager to modify permissions, limits, and allowed assets/protocols anytime.

**Do unused period limits roll over?**
No. Each period starts fresh with the full limit. Use it or lose it.

**Can managers see my full portfolio?**
Managers can only interact with assets you've specifically allowed them to access.

## Working with Other Features

### Managers and Payees
- Managers can transfer to approved [payees](payees.md) within their limits
- Add payee restrictions to limit manager transfers to known addresses
- Perfect for accounts payable roles with vendor payment access

### Managers and Cheques
- Managers can create [cheques](cheques.md) within their spending limits
- Cheque amounts count against manager's daily/period/lifetime caps
- Time delays on cheques add extra security layer

### Managers and Whitelist
- Managers cannot modify the [whitelist](whitelist.md)
- Whitelisted addresses bypass all manager restrictions
- Use whitelist for emergency access, managers for daily operations

### Managers and Rewards
- Managers can claim [rewards](rewards.md) if given permission
- Cannot change reward settings or ambassador codes
- Useful for automated reward compounding strategies


## The Bottom Line

Stop choosing between control and automation. Managers let you have both.

Grant specific permissions. Set unbreakable limits. Revoke instantly. Sleep soundly knowing your portfolio is optimizing 24/7 within boundaries you control.

Whether it's a family member who needs emergency access, an AI that never sleeps, or a professional service with institutional strategies — Managers transform your static wallet into a dynamic financial command center.

The future of DeFi isn't about choosing the right protocol. It's about having the right operators executing the right strategies at the right time. With Managers, that future is here.
