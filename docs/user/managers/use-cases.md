## Use Cases & Possibilities

Managers unlock a new level of functionality and automation for your wallet.

#### The Automated Yield Farmer AI Agent
Set up an AI Agent as a Manager with permissions to `Manage Yield` and `Claim Rewards`. This agent can work for you 24/7, automatically harvesting rewards from your DeFi positions and compounding them back into your yield-bearing assets to maximize your returns.

#### The Secure Spending Allowance
Delegate a Manager to a team member with `Transfer` permissions but with strict controls like a low **Max USD Value Per Period** and a specific list of **Allowed Payees**.

#### The Portfolio Rebalancer AI Agent
Appoint an AI-powered rebalancing service as a Manager with `Buy and Sell` permissions to execute swaps and maintain your target portfolio allocation. You can use **Financial Limits** to ensure it can't drain your account in a single trade.

#### Professional AI Services - The Next Level
The most powerful way to use Managers is with professional AI services that provide sophisticated portfolio management. Here's how it works in simple terms:

**Think of it like hiring a professional investment firm:**
1. The AI service has their own "office" (their AgentWrapper contract)
2. You add their office address as a Manager in your wallet
3. You set strict rules: "You can trade up to $10,000 per month, only in ETH and stablecoins"
4. The AI service operates within these limits, optimizing your portfolio 24/7

**Why This Is Revolutionary:**
* **No Private Keys**: The service never has your private keys or seed phrase
* **Atomic Strategies**: The AI can execute complex strategies in one transaction (withdraw → swap → deposit)
* **Professional Grade**: Access institutional-level trading strategies from your personal wallet
* **Always in Control**: You can revoke access instantly if needed

**Real Example:**
Imagine an AI yield optimizer service:
- You authorize it with "Manage Yield" permissions
- Set a $50,000 per month limit
- Restrict it to only use Aave, Compound, and Morpho
- The AI monitors rates 24/7 and moves your funds to the highest yields
- It pays all the gas fees
- You earn an extra 2-3% APY with zero effort

This is the future of DeFi: professional-grade automation with retail-level control and security.
