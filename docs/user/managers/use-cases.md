### Professional AI Services - The Next Level
The most powerful way to use Managers is with professional AI services that provide sophisticated portfolio management. Here's how it works in simple terms:

**Think of it like hiring a professional investment firm:**
1. The AI service has their own "office" (their AgentWrapper contract)
2. You add their office address as a Manager in your wallet
3. You set strict rules: "You can trade up to $10,000 per month, only in ETH and stablecoins"
4. The AI service operates within these limits, optimizing your portfolio 24/7

**Why This Is Revolutionary:**
* **No Private Keys**: The service never has your private keys or seed phrase
* **Atomic Strategies**: The AI can execute complex strategies in one transaction (withdraw → swap → deposit)
* **Professional Grade**: Access institutional-level trading strategies from your personal wallet
* **Always in Control**: You can revoke access instantly if needed

**Real Example - Professional Yield Optimizer:**

**Your Setup**:
- Portfolio: $250,000 in stablecoins
- Manager: YieldMaxAI Service
- Permissions: Manage Yield, Claim Rewards
- Limits: $50,000 per tx, $500,000 per month
- Allowed Protocols: Aave, Compound, Morpho, Yearn
- Activation: 7-day delay, 1-year duration

**What Happens**:
1. YieldMaxAI monitors 20+ yield sources every block
2. When Morpho offers 12% vs Aave's 8%, it executes:
   - Withdraw from Aave → Deposit to Morpho (one atomic transaction)
3. Auto-harvests and compounds rewards every 8 hours
4. Pays all gas fees (you pay nothing)
5. Sends you weekly performance reports

**The Numbers**:
- Base yield without optimization: 8% = $20,000/year
- Optimized yield with AI: 11% = $27,500/year
- Your extra profit: $7,500/year
- Your effort: Zero
