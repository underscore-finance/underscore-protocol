## Overview

Imagine having a tireless financial assistant who works 24/7, optimizing your portfolio while you sleep, but can never exceed the strict limits you set. That's the power of **Managers** in your Underscore User Wallet.

Unlike traditional finance where you hand over complete control to an advisor, or other DeFi protocols where delegation means trusting someone with your private keys, Underscore's Manager system is revolutionary: you maintain ultimate control while enabling sophisticated automation.

### What Makes This Special

**Traditional Finance**: Give your advisor full control and hope they act in your best interest.
**Other Crypto Wallets**: Share private keys or seed phrases, risking everything.
**Underscore Managers**: Grant specific, limited, revocable permissions enforced by unbreakable smart contract rules.

### Real-World Impact

With Managers, you can:
* **Take a vacation** while your AI agent rebalances your portfolio to capture the best yields
* **Run a business** with team members who can pay expenses without accessing your treasury
* **Sleep soundly** knowing your trading bot can't lose more than your set limits
* **Support family** by giving them emergency access without compromising your life savings

### The Technology Behind the Magic

Managers can be:
* **Trusted People**: Family members, business partners, or team members
* **Professional Services**: Registered financial services with proven track records
* **AI Agents**: Sophisticated algorithms that optimize your portfolio 24/7

#### Why AI Agents Are Finally Safe
Traditional AI wallets are risky—if the AI or its server is compromised, you lose everything. Underscore changes the game:
* **Hard Limits**: Set a maximum of $10,000 per month, and the AI literally cannot spend $10,001
* **Transparent Rules**: Every permission is visible on-chain—no hidden capabilities
* **Instant Revocation**: Remove a manager with one transaction if anything seems wrong
* **Time-Locked Activation**: New managers can't act immediately, giving you time to verify

### Core Benefits at a Glance
* **Secure Delegation**: Like giving someone a credit card with a strict limit instead of your bank account
* **Advanced Automation**: Professional-grade portfolio management that never sleeps
* **Gasless Experience**: Many AI services pay the gas fees for you
* **Emergency Safety**: You can revoke access instantly, and the protocol security team provides an additional safety net
