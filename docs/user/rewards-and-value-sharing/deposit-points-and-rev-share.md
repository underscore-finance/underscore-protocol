## Earning from Protocol Fees (Deposit Points & Rev Share)

Your wallet isn't just storing value - it's actively earning you a share of every fee generated across the entire Underscore ecosystem. Here's how it works in practice.

### Deposit Points: Your Automatic Earning Power

Think of Deposit Points as your "ownership stake" in the protocol's success. They're not tokens you trade - they're your automatic, real-time calculation of how much you've earned.

#### How Your Earnings Grow

**The Math is Simple:**
- Hold $1,000 in your wallet = Earn like you own 0.1% of the protocol (if total value is $1M)
- Hold $10,000 = Earn like you own 1%
- Hold $100,000 = Earn like you own 10%

**Real Example:**
Sarah deposits $5,000 worth of stETH into her User Wallet. The protocol has $500,000 total value locked. Sarah now has 1% of all Deposit Points. When the protocol collects $10,000 in fees this week, Sarah automatically earns $100 (her 1% share).

#### Time-Based Accumulation = Loyalty Rewards

Here's what most people don't realize: your points grow over time, not just from your balance. Hold assets for 30 days? Your share increases. Hold for 90 days? Even more. This rewards loyal users who trust the protocol long-term.

### How You Actually Get Paid

Unlike complex staking systems, Underscore's distribution is refreshingly straightforward:

1. **Fees Accumulate**: Every swap, yield harvest, and reward claim across all wallets generates fees
2. **Distribution Triggers**: After 24-48 hours, anyone can trigger a distribution (yes, even you!)
3. **Instant Calculation**: The smart contract instantly calculates everyone's share
4. **Direct Payment**: Your earnings appear in your wallet, ready to use or compound

#### Ambassador Boost: Passive Income Multiplier

When someone you referred earns fees, you get an automatic cut:
- User performs a $10,000 swap â†’ generates $10 fee
- They get 70% ($7) in points
- You get 30% ($3) in points as their ambassador
- This happens forever, with no action required

**Power User Example:**
Mark referred 10 active traders. They collectively generate $1,000 in fees monthly. Mark automatically earns $300/month in ambassador rewards, on top of his own trading rewards.
