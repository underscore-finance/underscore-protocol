## Earning from Special Promotions (Yield Bonuses)

Think of Yield Bonuses as "double rewards" - you earn your normal yield PLUS special bonus rewards just for holding assets in your Underscore wallet. These limited-time promotions can significantly boost your returns.

### How Yield Bonuses Multiply Your Earnings

**Example Scenario:**
The protocol launches a 30-day stETH promotion:
- Your stETH earns its normal 5% APY
- PLUS you earn an additional 3% APY in bonus rewards
- Total return: 8% APY for the promotion period

But here's where it gets interesting...

### Real Examples of Yield Bonus Campaigns

**The Lido Partnership Launch**  
When Underscore partnered with a major liquid staking protocol:
- Users holding stETH earned bonus LDO tokens
- Average user with $10,000 stETH earned $150 in LDO over 30 days
- Some power users earned thousands in bonus tokens
- All while keeping their regular stETH yield

**The Stablecoin Summer**  
A 90-day campaign for USDC yield positions:
- 2% bonus APY paid in USDC
- Perfect for risk-averse users wanting stable returns
- A $50,000 position earned an extra $250 in bonus USDC
- Combined with regular yield for 7-8% total APY on stablecoins

### Types of Bonus Rewards You Can Earn

**1. Same-Asset Bonuses**  
Hold wstETH → Earn bonus wstETH  
Your position grows faster through compound rewards. A $10,000 position could become $10,300 after a typical 3-month campaign.

**2. Base-Asset Bonuses**  
Hold stETH → Earn bonus ETH  
Get liquid rewards you can use immediately. Perfect for users who want to take profits without unwrapping their yield positions.

**3. Partner Token Bonuses**  
Hold rETH → Earn RPL governance tokens  
Access to valuable governance tokens through strategic partnerships. Often the highest-value rewards, especially during bull markets.

### Maximizing Your Yield Bonus Strategy

**Stack Multiple Bonuses:**
- Hold assets eligible for multiple concurrent bonuses
- Example: stETH bonus + general deposit points + ambassador rewards
- Some users achieve 15-20% effective APY during peak campaigns

**Time Your Entry:**
- Bonuses often have limited budgets
- Early participants may earn higher rates
- Watch for announcement channels to catch new campaigns

**Choose Strategic Assets:**
- Blue-chip yield tokens (stETH, rETH) often have the best bonuses
- Newer protocols may offer higher bonuses to attract users
- Balance risk and reward based on your goals

### Tracking and Claiming Your Bonuses

Your wallet dashboard shows:
- Active bonus campaigns you're participating in
- Accumulated rewards in real-time
- Time remaining in each campaign
- One-click claiming when you're ready

**Pro Tip**: You don't need to claim daily. Bonuses accumulate securely and can be claimed whenever gas fees are favorable. Some users claim monthly to compound efficiently.

The beauty of Yield Bonuses? They're pure upside. You take no extra risk, make no complex decisions - just hold your preferred yield assets in Underscore and earn extra rewards automatically.
