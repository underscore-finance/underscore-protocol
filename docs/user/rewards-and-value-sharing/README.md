## Understanding Underscore's Rewards System

The Underscore Protocol distributes protocol-generated fees back to users through a transparent, on-chain rewards system. When you use the protocol for swaps, yield generation, or external rewards claiming, a portion of the fees collected are shared with active participants.

### How Rewards Work

The protocol collects fees from value-generating activities and distributes them through the `LootDistributor` smart contract. Your share is determined by your participation level and calculated transparently on-chain.

**Three Types of Rewards**:

**1. Revenue Sharing Through Deposit Points**  
Your share of protocol fees is calculated based on your deposit value and time held. The formula: `Points = USD Value Ã— Blocks Held / 10^18`. Higher balances and longer holding periods result in more points, which determine your percentage of fee distributions.

**2. Ambassador Revenue Share**  
When users you refer generate fees, you receive a percentage (typically 20-30%) of their fee contributions. This creates ongoing revenue sharing between ambassadors and their referrals. The exact percentage varies by fee type.

**3. Yield Bonuses**  
Eligible yield-bearing assets may earn additional bonuses during promotional periods. These bonuses can be paid in the same asset, the underlying asset, or partner tokens. Bonus rates and eligibility are configured per asset and may change.
