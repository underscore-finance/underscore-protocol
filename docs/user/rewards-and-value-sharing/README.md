## Turn Your DeFi Activity Into Passive Income

Imagine earning rewards not just from your yield-bearing assets, but from every swap, every transaction, every moment your funds are working in DeFi. That's the reality with Underscore's rewards system.

### Your Share of a Growing Ecosystem

The Underscore Protocol isn't just another DeFi platform - it's a cooperative ecosystem where your success directly translates into rewards. Every action you take generates value, and you automatically earn your fair share through three powerful mechanisms:

**1. Revenue Sharing Through Deposit Points**  
Your wallet balance directly determines your share of protocol fees. Hold $10,000 in assets? You're earning proportionally more than someone with $1,000. It's that simple. The more value you bring, the more you earn.

**2. Ambassador Rewards**  
Invite friends and earn from their success forever. When someone you refer generates fees, you automatically receive a portion. Build a network of active users and watch your passive income grow.

**3. Yield Bonuses**  
Beyond regular revenue sharing, earn special promotional rewards for holding specific assets. These limited-time opportunities can significantly boost your returns, often through partnerships that bring additional token rewards.

### Real Numbers, Real Returns

Unlike platforms that promise vague "rewards," Underscore's system is transparent and measurable:
- Every fee generated is tracked on-chain
- Your exact share is calculated in real-time
- Distributions happen regularly and publicly
- No hidden mechanics or centralized decisions

The `LootDistributor` smart contract handles everything automatically, ensuring fair and transparent reward distribution to all participants.
