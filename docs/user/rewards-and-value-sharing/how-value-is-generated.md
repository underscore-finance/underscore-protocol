## How Protocol Value Is Generated (Fees)

Understanding how fees work is crucial: Underscore only charges fees on value-generating actions, and these fees become YOUR rewards through the revenue sharing system. Here's exactly how it works with real numbers.

### Fee Structure: Fair and Transparent

**1. Yield Fee: 10% of Profits Only**
- You deposit $10,000 in stETH earning 5% APY
- After one month, you've earned ~$42 in yield
- Fee: $4.20 (10% of profit)
- You keep: $37.80
- That $4.20 goes to the reward pool that YOU share in

**Key Point**: Fees are only on profits, never on principal. If your position doesn't earn yield, you pay nothing.

**2. Swap Fee: 0.1% Per Trade**
- You swap $5,000 USDC for ETH
- Fee: $5
- You receive: $4,995 worth of ETH
- Competitive with DEX fees, but you earn rewards back

**Real Trader Example:**
Tom trades $50,000 volume monthly:
- Monthly fees paid: $50
- His deposit points share: 2% of protocol
- Monthly rewards earned: ~$100
- Net profit: $50 from his own trading activity

**3. Rewards Fee: 10% of External Claims**
- You claim $200 in CRV rewards from Curve
- Fee: $20
- You keep: $180
- Again, only on profits from external protocols

### Why This Model Benefits You

**Traditional Platforms:**
- Pay fees → Platform keeps everything
- No ownership, no revenue share
- Fees are a pure cost

**Underscore Model:**
- Pay fees → Fees go to reward pool
- You own deposit points → You earn from the pool
- Fees become an investment in your earnings

### Real-World Impact

Let's look at an active user's monthly breakdown:

**Sarah's Monthly Activity:**
- Wallet Balance: $25,000 in yield positions
- Yield earned: $104 (5% APY)
- Swaps performed: $10,000 volume
- External rewards claimed: $50

**Fees Paid:**
- Yield fee: $10.40
- Swap fees: $10
- Rewards fee: $5
- Total fees: $25.40

**Rewards Earned:**
- Her deposit points: 2.5% of protocol
- Protocol monthly fees: $10,000
- Her share: $250
- Net gain: $224.60

She paid $25 in fees but earned $250 in rewards - a 10x return!

### Different Fee Ratios by Action Type

Not all fees are distributed equally:
- **Swap fees**: 70% to users, 30% to ambassadors
- **Yield fees**: 60% to users, 30% to ambassadors, 10% to protocol
- **Reward fees**: 80% to users, 20% to ambassadors

This incentivizes different activities and rewards both users and ambassadors fairly.

### The Bottom Line

Every fee you pay is an investment in the ecosystem you're part of. Active users consistently earn more in rewards than they pay in fees. The more the protocol grows, the more everyone earns. It's a true win-win model where your success drives collective success.
