## The Ambassador Program

The Ambassador Program creates a revenue-sharing relationship between you and users who join through your referral. When they generate protocol fees, you automatically receive a percentage of those fees as ambassador rewards.

### How Ambassador Relationships Work

**Setup Process:**
1. Share your User Wallet address with potential users
2. They enter your address as their ambassador during wallet creation
3. The relationship is recorded permanently on-chain
4. You earn a percentage of all fees they generate

**Revenue Share Percentages:**
- Swap fees: ~30% ambassador share
- Yield fees: ~30% ambassador share
- External rewards fees: ~20% ambassador share

*Note: Exact percentages are configured in the smart contract and may vary*

### Realistic Example Calculations

**Small Network Example:**
You refer 5 active users who each:
- Hold $10,000 in yield positions (5% APY)
- Generate $41.67 monthly yield
- Pay ~$4.17 in yield fees (10%)

Your monthly ambassador earnings:
- 5 users × $4.17 fees × 30% share = $6.25
- Annual passive income: ~$75

**Active Trader Network:**
You refer 10 traders who each:
- Trade $20,000 monthly volume
- Pay $20 in swap fees (0.1%)

Your monthly ambassador earnings:
- 10 users × $20 fees × 30% share = $60
- Annual passive income: ~$720

**Growth Scenario:**
A network of 50 mixed users (holders + traders):
- Average fees per user: $15/month
- Your 30% share: $4.50 per user
- Monthly earnings: $225
- Annual passive income: $2,700

### Program Characteristics

**Permanent On-Chain Relationships**: 
- Once established, ambassador relationships cannot be changed
- Earnings continue as long as users remain active
- No expiration or time limits

**Scalability**:
- No limit on number of referrals
- Earnings scale with user activity
- Automated distribution via smart contract

**Important Considerations**:
- Earnings depend entirely on user activity
- Inactive users generate no fees
- Market conditions affect trading volume and yields
- Your earnings = sum of (each user's fees × ambassador percentage)

### Building an Effective Network

**Target Users Most Likely to Generate Fees:**

**Growth Strategy:**
