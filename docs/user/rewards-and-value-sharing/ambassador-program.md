## The Ambassador Program: Build Your DeFi Network

Turn your network into a revenue stream. The Ambassador Program isn't just a referral system - it's your opportunity to build lasting, passive income by helping others discover the power of Underscore.

### How It Works in Practice

When someone creates their User Wallet and names you as their Ambassador, you've just gained a permanent income stream. Every fee they generate, forever, shares rewards with you.

**The Setup is Simple:**
1. Share your User Wallet address with friends
2. They enter it when creating their wallet
3. You're now permanently linked on-chain
4. Start earning from their activity immediately

### The Power of Network Effects

Here's what makes the Ambassador Program special:

**Permanent Relationships**: Unlike temporary referral bonuses, your ambassador relationship lasts forever. Someone you refer today could be earning you rewards 5 years from now.

**No Limits**: Refer 10 people? 100? 1,000? There's no cap on ambassador relationships or earnings.

**Compounding Growth**: As your referrals' wallets grow and they become more active, your earnings automatically increase. Their success is literally your success.

### Maximizing Your Ambassador Earnings

**Target Active Users**: Focus on people who will actually use DeFi features:
- Yield farmers seeking better returns
- Active traders looking for efficient swaps
- DAOs needing treasury management
- Businesses wanting automated payments

**Provide Value**: The most successful ambassadors don't just share a link - they:
- Explain specific features that solve problems
- Show real examples of earnings potential
- Offer guidance on getting started
- Build communities around shared success

### Tracking Your Network

Your User Wallet dashboard provides complete transparency:
- List of all wallets you're ambassador for
- Individual earnings from each referral
- Total monthly ambassador income
- Activity metrics for your network

Remember: Being an ambassador isn't about aggressive marketing. It's about sharing a tool that genuinely helps people earn more from their DeFi activities. When they succeed, you succeed - permanently.
