## Overview

Running a business or managing regular payments in crypto can be stressful. You worry about missing payroll while traveling, manually processing each payment, or accidentally sending too much. **Payees** solve these problems by creating automated, controlled payment relationships directly from your wallet.

### What Are Payees?

A Payee is a pre-approved address (person, service, or smart contract) that can receive funds from your wallet according to rules you define. It's like setting up automatic bill pay at your bank, but with far more control and transparency.

### Why Payees Matter

**Traditional Crypto Payments**: Manual, error-prone, and time-consuming. One wrong digit in an amount or address can be costly.

**Traditional Banking**: Automatic payments exist but you're limited by banking hours, wire fees, and opaque systems.

**Underscore Payees**: Programmable payment relationships with crystal-clear rules, no intermediaries, and 24/7 operation.

### Real-World Benefits

* **Run Payroll from Anywhere**: Set up your team as Payees with monthly limits. Payments happen automatically, even while you're offline.

* **Never Miss a Payment**: Your funds can be earning yield in Aave or Compound. When a payment is due, the system automatically sources what's needed.

* **Prevent Costly Mistakes**: Set a maximum of $5,000 per payment to your vendor. Even if you accidentally enter $50,000, the system will cap it at your limit.

* **Streamline Operations**: No more logging into multiple platforms or paying wire transfer fees. Everything runs from your wallet.

### How It Works

1. **Add a Payee**: Specify their address and set your rules
2. **Define Limits**: How much, how often, which tokens
3. **Set and Forget**: Payments execute automatically within your rules
4. **Stay in Control**: Modify or revoke access anytime

The best part? Your funds keep earning yield until the moment they're needed for a payment. No more choosing between liquidity and returns.
