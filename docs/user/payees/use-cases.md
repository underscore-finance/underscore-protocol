## Use Cases & Possibilities

Payees unlock practical solutions to real-world payment challenges. Here are concrete ways businesses and individuals use them today.

### Small Business Operations

### Advanced Integration

**AI-Powered Vendor Onboarding**
An AI Manager monitors your business systems and streamlines payments:
1. **Invoice arrives** in your accounting software
2. **AI Agent** reads invoice and proposes vendor as Payee
3. **Smart limits** set based on invoice amount and history
4. **You approve** after time-lock security delay
5. **Payment executes** automatically on due date

*Real example*: Marketing agency processes 50+ vendor payments monthly. AI Agent reduces payment processing from hours to minutes while maintaining security.

**Smart Contract Integration**
Your protocol or DAO can integrate Payees for automated operations:
- Grant distributions based on governance votes
- Contributor payments triggered by completed milestones  
- Service provider fees pulled when work is verified
- All without custodial risk or manual intervention

### The Debit Card Revolution

Imagine a debit card that:
- Links directly to your DeFi wallet
- Pulls exact payment amounts as you spend
- Respects your preset daily/monthly limits
- Keeps remaining funds earning yield

*How it works*: Card provider is a Pull Payee with daily limit. When you buy coffee for $5, they pull exactly $5 from your yield-earning USDC. Your money works for you until the second you spend it.

### Why These Use Cases Matter

Each example shows how Payees solve real problems:
- **Time**: Automate repetitive payments
- **Security**: Never give full wallet access
- **Flexibility**: Modify limits as needs change
- **Yield**: Funds earn until needed
- **Control**: Cancel or adjust instantly

The best part? These aren't theoretical. Businesses and individuals use Payees today to streamline operations while maintaining complete control of their funds.
