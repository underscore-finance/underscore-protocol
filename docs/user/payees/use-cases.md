## Use Cases & Possibilities

Payees unlock practical solutions to real-world payment challenges. Here are concrete ways businesses and individuals use them today.

### Small Business Operations

**Automated Payroll Without the Hassle**
Sarah runs a design agency with 5 employees and $40,000 monthly payroll:

| Employee | Role | Monthly Pay | Configuration |
|----------|------|-------------|---------------|
| John | Senior Designer | $8,000 | 2 payments/mo, USDC only |
| Maria | Developer | $10,000 | 1 payment/mo, 25-day cooldown |
| David | Junior Designer | $5,000 | 2 payments/mo, $2,500 per tx |
| Amy | Project Manager | $7,000 | 1 payment/mo, USDC only |
| Tom | Marketing | $6,000 | 1 payment/mo, flexible tokens |

**Financial Impact**:
- Payroll fund: $480,000 annually
- Earning 5% APY until payment: ~$2,000 extra per year
- Time saved: 4 hours monthly on payment processing
- Cost savings: No payroll service fees ($200/month = $2,400/year)

**Vendor Management Made Simple**
Her agency's vendor setup with real numbers:

```
Monthly Vendor Costs:
- AWS hosting: $500/month (pull enabled, $600 cap)
- Adobe Suite: $300/month (pull enabled, strict limit)
- Freelancers: $5,000/month budget (individual caps)
- Office rent: $3,000/month (landlord payee)
Total: $8,800/month in automated payments

Yield benefit: $8,800 × 5% ÷ 12 = ~$37/month
Annual benefit: ~$440 from vendor payment float
```

### Personal Finance

**Subscription Management That Makes Sense**
Alex manages $523/month in crypto subscriptions:

```
Service         | Monthly | Annual  | Configuration
----------------|---------|---------|---------------
TradingView Pro | $59     | $708    | Pull, $65 cap
Nansen          | $149    | $1,788  | Pull, $160 cap

Discord Nitro   | $10     | $120    | Pull, $15 cap
News Terminal   | $206    | $2,472  | Pull, $220 cap

Total: $523/month = $6,276/year
Yield earned at 5%: $314/year
Effective cost: $5,962 (5% discount from yield!)
```

**Family Financial Support**
Supporting family becomes transparent with specific limits:

| Recipient | Purpose | Monthly | Annual | Special Rules |
|-----------|---------|---------|---------|---------------|
| Daughter (college) | Living expenses | $2,000 | $24,000 | USDC only, 2 payments/mo |
| Son (startup) | Emergency fund | $0 | $10,000 lifetime | Pull enabled, he controls |
| Parents | Retirement help | $1,500 | $18,000 | Monthly on the 1st |
| Sister | Medical support | $500 | $6,000 | Flexible timing |

**Total family support**: $4,000/month when active
**Yield benefit**: ~$200/year on float
**Control benefit**: Can adjust or stop anytime

### Advanced Integration

**AI-Powered Vendor Onboarding**
An AI Manager monitors your business systems and streamlines payments:
1. **Invoice arrives** in your accounting software
2. **AI Agent** reads invoice and proposes vendor as Payee
3. **Smart limits** set based on invoice amount and history
4. **You approve** after time-lock security delay
5. **Payment executes** automatically on due date

*Real example*: Marketing agency processes 50+ vendor payments monthly. AI Agent reduces payment processing from hours to minutes while maintaining security.

**Smart Contract Integration**
Your protocol or DAO can integrate Payees for automated operations:
- Grant distributions based on governance votes
- Contributor payments triggered by completed milestones  
- Service provider fees pulled when work is verified
- All without custodial risk or manual intervention

### The Debit Card Revolution

Imagine a debit card that:
- Links directly to your DeFi wallet
- Pulls exact payment amounts as you spend
- Respects your preset daily/monthly limits
- Keeps remaining funds earning yield

*How it works*: Card provider is a Pull Payee with daily limit. When you buy coffee for $5, they pull exactly $5 from your yield-earning USDC. Your money works for you until the second you spend it.

### ROI Calculator: Medium Business Example

**Traditional Payroll Service**:
- Monthly fee: $200
- Per-employee fee: $5 × 20 = $100
- Wire fees: $30 × 20 = $600
- Total monthly cost: $900
- Annual cost: $10,800
- Yield on idle funds: ~$0

**Underscore Payees**:
- Setup: One-time gas fees ~$100
- Monthly gas: ~$50
- Annual gas costs: ~$700
- Yield on $200k payroll float: ~$10,000
- Net benefit: +$9,300/year

**Result**: Save $10,800 in fees, earn $10,000 in yield = **$20,100 annual improvement**

### Why These Use Cases Matter

Each example demonstrates quantifiable benefits:

- **Time Savings**: 5-10 hours monthly on payment processing
- **Cost Reduction**: $100-1,000 monthly in service fees eliminated
