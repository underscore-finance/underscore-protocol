## Use Cases & Possibilities

Cheques solve real payment challenges that crypto users face every day. Here are practical ways people and businesses use them.

### Freelance & Contract Work

**The Invoice That Pays Itself**
Sarah, a freelance designer, completes a logo project. Instead of hoping for payment, she receives a Cheque:
- Amount: $3,000 USDC
- Unlock: 3 days (21,600 blocks)
- Expiry: 30 days (216,000 blocks)
- Pull enabled: Sarah can claim it when ready

**Financial benefit**:
- Client's funds earn 5% APY during 3-day review: ~$1.25
- If Sarah waits 10 days to claim: ~$4.10 total yield
- Traditional invoice factoring cost avoided: $90-150 (3-5% fee)

The client shows commitment while maintaining the ability to cancel if deliverables aren't met. Sarah sees the payment is secured and can plan accordingly.

**Milestone-Based Projects**
A development agency working on a 3-month project:
- Milestone 1: $10,000 cheque unlocks after phase 1 review (7 days)
- Milestone 2: $15,000 cheque created at project midpoint
- Final payment: $25,000 cheque with 14-day review period

Each cheque can be cancelled if milestones aren't met, protecting both parties.

### Personal Finance

**Rent Payments with a Safety Net**
Mark sets up his monthly rent as a cheque:
- Amount: $2,500 USDC
- Created: 25th of each month
- Unlocks: 1st of next month
- His landlord can pull the payment
- If Mark needs to move suddenly, he can cancel next month's cheque

**Lending Between Friends**
Helping a friend with a temporary loan:
- Create a $1,000 cheque as the loan
- They cash it when needed
- For repayment, they create a cheque back to you
- Future-dated for the agreed repayment date
- Both parties have transparency and control

### Business Operations

**Refundable Deposits**
An equipment rental company uses cheques for security deposits:
- Customer pays $500 deposit via regular transfer
- Company creates a $500 return cheque
- Unlocks after rental period + inspection (7 days = 50,400 blocks)
- If equipment is damaged, they cancel and create a partial refund
- If all is well, customer pulls their full deposit

**Company benefit**: 
- Traditional escrow service: $25-50 per transaction
- Underscore cheques: ~$3 gas cost
- Monthly volume (100 rentals): Save $2,200-4,700
- Deposit funds earn yield: ~$125/month on $50,000 float

**Salary Advances**
Companies can offer salary advances safely:
- Employee requests $2,000 advance
- Company creates cheque dated for next payday (15 days)
- Instant threshold: $5,000 (no delay needed)
- If employee leaves early, cheque can be cancelled
- Otherwise, guaranteed payment on payday

**ROI calculation**:
- Payday loan alternative APR: 300-500%
- Employee saves: $115-192 in interest
- Company earns: ~$4 yield on 15-day float
- Employee retention value: Significant

### Smart Contract Integration

**Escrow Services**
A marketplace can use cheques for escrow:
1. Buyer pays marketplace
2. Marketplace creates cheque to seller
3. Unlock time = shipping + inspection period
4. If buyer confirms receipt, seller claims payment
5. If dispute arises, marketplace can cancel and arbitrate

**Contest and Bounty Programs**
Running a hackathon or bug bounty:
- Create multiple cheques for different prize tiers
- Set unlock date after judging period
- Cancel and redistribute if submissions don't meet criteria
- Winners can claim prizes at their convenience

### Advanced Automation

**AI-Powered Invoice Processing**
A business uses an AI Manager to handle payables:
1. Invoice arrives and AI validates it
2. AI creates cheque matching invoice terms
3. Automatic time delay for large amounts (over $5,000)
4. Finance team reviews large cheques during delay period
5. Routine payments process without intervention

**Conditional Payments**
Smart contracts can create cheques based on conditions:
- Performance bonuses that unlock after KPIs are verified
- Insurance payouts that activate after claim validation
- Affiliate commissions that release after the refund period

### Why These Matter

Each use case shows how cheques solve specific problems:
- **Trust**: Both parties see the commitment
- **Flexibility**: Cancel or modify before execution
- **Automation**: Set up future payments today
- **Safety**: Time delays for large amounts
- **Transparency**: Everyone knows the terms

Best of all, funds can keep earning yield in your wallet until the moment the cheque is cashed. No more opportunity cost from escrow accounts or advanced payments.
