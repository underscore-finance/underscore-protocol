## Overview

We've all been there—you send a crypto payment and immediately realize there's a problem. Maybe the amount was wrong, or the project turns out to be different than expected. With traditional crypto transfers, that money is gone forever. **Cheques** change this by bringing the safety and flexibility of traditional banking to DeFi.

### What Are Cheques?

A Cheque is a blockchain-native payment that you can schedule, cancel, or modify before it's cashed. Think of it as the best parts of a paper check, a wire transfer, and an escrow service combined into one smart contract primitive.

### Why Cheques Matter

**Traditional Crypto Payments**: Instant, irreversible, and nerve-wracking for large amounts.

**Bank Wire Transfers**: Often have recall periods but require calling your bank, waiting on hold, and hoping they can help.

**Underscore Cheques**: Full control until the moment of payment, with automatic safety features and transparent rules.

### Real-World Benefits

* **Peace of Mind**: Made a mistake? Cancel the cheque before it's cashed. No more staying up at night worrying about that large transfer.

* **Better Business Relationships**: Send a cheque for services rendered. The recipient sees the commitment, but you maintain control until work is verified.

* **Automatic Safety**: Set a threshold (like $1,000) above which all cheques get an automatic security delay. Large payments get extra scrutiny without manual intervention.

* **Future Planning**: Schedule payments weeks or months ahead. Perfect for rent, salaries, or any predictable expense.

### How It Works

1. **Write a Cheque**: Specify recipient, amount, and timing
2. **Security Check**: Large amounts automatically get a time delay
3. **Waiting Period**: Cheque is visible but can't be cashed yet
4. **Active Period**: Recipient can cash it, or you can still cancel
5. **Settlement**: Funds transfer only when explicitly executed

The USD value is recorded at creation time, making accounting and tax reporting straightforward—no more guessing what that payment was worth when you made it.
