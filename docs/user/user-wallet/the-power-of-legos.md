## The Power of Legos

The true power of your User Wallet lies in its integration with **Legos**. Think of Legos as secure, vetted "apps" representing different DeFi protocols that can be plugged into your wallet. They all use a common interface, which means adding new capabilities is as simple as building a new block.

### What This Means for You

**Never Get Left Behind**: While others scramble to move funds between wallets as new protocols launch, your wallet automatically gains access to new opportunities as soon as they're integrated.

**One Wallet, Endless Possibilities**: Instead of managing dozens of different interfaces and remembering multiple wallet addresses, you have one secure home base that can do it all.

**Safety Through Standardization**: Every Lego goes through rigorous security review and uses standardized interfaces. This means new features don't introduce new risks—they inherit your wallet's robust security model.

### Growing Ecosystem

**Today**, your wallet can connect to Legos for:
* **Trading** on decentralized exchanges like Uniswap, Aerodrome, and Curve—access millions in liquidity
* **Earning Yield** on lending protocols like Aave, Morpho, Euler, and Compound—put your assets to work
* **Borrowing & Debt Management** through collateralized debt protocols like Ripe Finance—unlock liquidity without selling

**Tomorrow**, new Legos could enable:
* **Liquid Staking** - Earn staking rewards while keeping your assets liquid
* **Advanced Derivatives** - Hedge positions or speculate with options and futures
* **Real-world Assets** - Access tokenized stocks, bonds, and commodities

### The Bottom Line

You're not just getting a wallet—you're joining an ecosystem that grows more powerful over time. Every new Lego that's added increases the value of your wallet without requiring any action from you. It's like having a smartphone that automatically gets new apps that make your life easier, except these apps help you build wealth.

Your assets stay in one secure place while the opportunities come to you. That's the power of Legos.
