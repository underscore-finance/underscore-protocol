## Built-in Security Tools

Integrated directly into your wallet is a suite of powerful primitives that give you unparalleled control and security over your assets.

### Managers
The ability to securely delegate tasks is built-in. You can authorize a trusted person, a team, or a sophisticated **AI Agent** to perform specific actions on your behalf, all while being constrained by rules you define in a transparent, on-chain smart contract.

**AI Agents - Your 24/7 Portfolio Assistant**: This is where Underscore truly shines. You can connect AI agents that act as tireless portfolio managers, operating within your predetermined safety parameters. Imagine having a professional trader who:
* Never sleeps and monitors markets around the clock
* Automatically rebalances your portfolio when opportunities arise
* Claims and reinvests rewards before they expire
* Moves funds to higher yields as rates change
* All while respecting your risk limits and never exceeding the permissions you've granted

The AI agent operates through cryptographic signatures, meaning it can only perform actions you've explicitly allowed. You maintain full control and can revoke access instantly if needed.

### Payees
Your wallet has a native system for creating secure, automated payment rails. Set up recurring payments for subscriptions or payroll with strict limits on amounts and frequency. Perfect for:
* Paying team members on a schedule
* Managing subscription services
* Creating dollar-cost averaging strategies
* Setting up automatic bill payments

### Cheques
You can write schedulable, revocable, on-chain payments. This is a core feature for managing one-off future transfers with security and control. Unlike traditional transfers, cheques can be:
* Scheduled for future dates
* Cancelled before execution if plans change
* Set with expiration dates for safety
* Used for escrow-like arrangements

### The Whitelist
Your wallet maintains its own whitelist, a list of addresses that represent the highest level of trust. A whitelisted address can receive unlimited funds, bypassing all other payment controls, making it perfect for managing your own set of wallets or a core treasury. This ensures you always have an emergency exit while maintaining strict controls on all other transfers.
