## Introduction

Welcome to your Underscore User Wallet. This is more than just a place to hold your crypto assets; it is a powerful, secure, and intelligent hub designed to manage your entire DeFi experience from a single point of control.

The User Wallet is built on two foundational principles: **uncompromising security** and **endless modularity**.

* **Security First**: Your wallet is protected by a suite of powerful, built-in management tools. Features like **Managers**, **Payees**, **Cheques**, and the **Whitelist** are not add-ons; they are core components of your wallet's security framework, giving you granular control over every action.
* **Endless Modularity**: Your wallet's capabilities can grow and adapt without you ever needing to move your funds. Through a groundbreaking system called **"Legos,"** new DeFi protocols and features can be plugged directly into your wallet, continuously expanding what's possible.

With an Underscore User Wallet, you no longer need to choose between security and access to the latest innovations in DeFi—you get both in one seamless package.

## Real-World Scenarios

Here's what becomes possible with your User Wallet:

**Automated Portfolio Management**: Set up an AI agent to monitor your yield positions across multiple protocols. When rates change, your agent can automatically move funds to better opportunities—all within the safety rules you've defined.

**Streamlined Business Operations**: Pay your team or contractors with scheduled payments that execute automatically. Set monthly limits, require multiple approvals for large amounts, and never worry about missing payroll.

**Family Financial Security**: Grant limited access to family members through the Manager system. They can help manage routine transactions while your high-value assets remain protected by time-locks and spending limits.

**Effortless Multi-Protocol Farming**: Deposit into multiple yield protocols with a single transaction. Your wallet tracks all positions in one place, making tax reporting and portfolio management straightforward.

These aren't future promises—they're available today, built directly into your wallet's core functionality.
