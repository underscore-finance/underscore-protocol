## Overview of the Hatchery

The **Hatchery** is the official creation hub for the Underscore Protocol. Think of it as the birthplace for every new User Wallet and AI Agent. Its primary purpose is to ensure that every new wallet is deployed securely, using upgradeable templates, and is equipped with a complete set of sensible default configurations from day one.

Whether you are a new user creating your first smart contract wallet or a developer deploying a sophisticated AI Agent, the Hatchery is your entry point into the Underscore ecosystem.
