## Use Cases

The Whitelist enables essential financial operations that require unrestricted transfers. Here are practical scenarios where whitelisting addresses makes sense.

### Personal Finance

#### Multi-Wallet Security Strategy
Many users maintain multiple wallets for security:
- **Hot Wallet**: Daily operations with $5,000 - $50,000
- **Hardware Wallet**: Long-term storage with $100,000 - $1,000,000
- **Multi-sig Vault**: Ultimate security for $1,000,000+

By whitelisting your hardware wallet and multi-sig addresses, you can instantly move funds to safety without worrying about hitting daily or transaction limits.

**Real Scenario**: Market crash begins. You have $500,000 in your hot wallet but only a $25,000 daily limit. With your hardware wallet whitelisted, you can immediately secure all funds instead of waiting 20 days.

#### Emergency Family Access
Life is unpredictable. Whitelisting a trusted family member's address ensures:
- Immediate access to funds in medical emergencies
- No delays due to payment limits during critical moments
- Peace of mind knowing loved ones can always receive support

**Example**: Sarah whitelists her spouse's wallet with a 3-day time-lock:
- Monday: Sarah proposes the address
- Thursday: Confirmation available
- Result: Spouse can receive $100,000 for emergency medical bills instantly, bypassing the $5,000 daily limit

### Business Operations

#### Treasury Management
Businesses often need to move large sums between wallets:
- **Operational Wallet** → **Main Treasury**: Daily revenue sweeps of $50,000-$200,000
- **Treasury** → **Payroll Wallet**: Monthly transfers of $500,000+
- **Treasury** → **Investment Wallet**: Deploying $1M+ in capital

Whitelisting these addresses enables smooth cash flow without artificial limits blocking legitimate business needs.

**ROI Example**: A business processes $3M monthly. Without whitelisting, a $50,000 daily limit would require 60 transactions and constant monitoring. With whitelisting: instant transfers, saving 10+ hours monthly in treasury operations.

#### Multi-Entity Operations
Companies with multiple entities or departments can whitelist:
- Subsidiary wallets for intercompany transfers
- Department wallets for budget allocations
- Partner organization wallets for joint ventures

### Trading and Investment

#### High-Frequency Trading Setup
Active traders often need:
- **Main Wallet** → **Exchange Wallet**: Deploy $100,000+ for opportunities
- **Profit Wallet** → **Cold Storage**: Secure $50,000+ gains immediately
- **Multiple Trading Wallets**: Manage $500,000+ across strategies

Whitelisting enables instant movement of large positions when market opportunities arise.

**Time-Critical Example**: Bitcoin flash crash to $25,000. You need to deploy $250,000 from cold storage immediately. With whitelisting, you can act in seconds instead of being limited to your $25,000 daily transfer limit.

#### DeFi Position Management
When managing complex DeFi positions:
- Quick rebalancing between wallets
- Emergency liquidation prevention transfers
- Profit taking without delay

### Special Situations

#### Estate Planning
Some users whitelist:
- Beneficiary addresses with clear documentation
- Trust wallet addresses
- Legal entity wallets for succession planning

#### Migration Scenarios
When upgrading wallet infrastructure:
- Whitelist new wallet before full migration
- Transfer assets in any size batches
- No risk of hitting limits during transition

### What NOT to Whitelist

Understanding what to avoid is equally important:

❌ **Exchange deposit addresses** - These can change without notice
❌ **Service provider wallets** - Use Payees with limits instead (e.g., $5,000/month for subscriptions)
❌ **New acquaintances** - Even if they seem trustworthy
❌ **Smart contracts** - Unless you've audited the code
❌ **Temporary addresses** - For one-time large transactions, use Cheques instead

**Why This Matters**: A whitelisted address can drain your entire wallet instantly. One mistake could mean total loss.

### Best Practices

1. **Start Minimal**: Only whitelist what you absolutely need
2. **Document Purposes**: Keep records of why each address is whitelisted
3. **Regular Reviews**: Remove addresses no longer needed (quarterly audit recommended)
4. **Test First**: Send $10 before relying on whitelist for large amounts
5. **Backup Access**: Ensure whitelisted addresses remain accessible
6. **Time Your Additions**: Add addresses during calm periods, not during crises

### The Two-Step Process in Practice

**Example Timeline**:
1. **Day 1 (Monday 2pm)**: Propose your hardware wallet for whitelisting
2. **Day 1-3**: Address enters pending status (cannot be used yet)
3. **Day 4 (Thursday 2pm)**: Time-lock expires, confirmation available
4. **Day 4+**: Confirm the addition, address is now whitelisted
5. **Result**: Can transfer any amount instantly

### The Cheque Exception

Remember: You cannot create Cheques for whitelisted addresses. This is by design—if an address has unlimited transfer access, there's no need for the controlled payment mechanism that Cheques provide.

**When to use each**:
- **Whitelist**: Your own wallets, emergency contacts, business treasuries
- **Cheques**: Contractors ($10,000 on completion), scheduled payments, one-time large transfers
- **Payees**: Regular vendors ($5,000/month), subscriptions, recurring services

The Whitelist is about removing friction where it matters most while maintaining security everywhere else.
