## Use Cases

The Whitelist enables essential financial operations that require unrestricted transfers. Here are practical scenarios where whitelisting addresses makes sense.

### Personal Finance

#### Multi-Wallet Security Strategy
Many users maintain multiple wallets for security:
- **Hot Wallet**: Daily operations with moderate funds
- **Hardware Wallet**: Long-term storage for majority of assets
- **Multi-sig Vault**: Ultimate security for largest holdings

By whitelisting your hardware wallet and multi-sig addresses, you can instantly move funds to safety without worrying about hitting daily or transaction limits.

#### Emergency Family Access
Life is unpredictable. Whitelisting a trusted family member's address ensures:
- Immediate access to funds in medical emergencies
- No delays due to payment limits during critical moments
- Peace of mind knowing loved ones can always receive support

*Example*: Sarah whitelists her spouse's wallet. If she's ever unable to manage her finances, her spouse can receive any necessary amount without restrictions.

### Business Operations

#### Treasury Management
Businesses often need to move large sums between wallets:
- **Operational Wallet** → **Main Treasury**: Daily revenue sweeps
- **Treasury** → **Payroll Wallet**: Funding monthly salaries
- **Treasury** → **Investment Wallet**: Deploying capital

Whitelisting these addresses enables smooth cash flow without artificial limits blocking legitimate business needs.

#### Multi-Entity Operations
Companies with multiple entities or departments can whitelist:
- Subsidiary wallets for intercompany transfers
- Department wallets for budget allocations
- Partner organization wallets for joint ventures

### Trading and Investment

#### High-Frequency Trading Setup
Active traders often need:
- **Main Wallet** → **Exchange Wallet**: Quick deployment of capital
- **Profit Wallet** → **Cold Storage**: Securing gains immediately
- **Multiple Trading Wallets**: Diversifying across strategies

Whitelisting enables instant movement of large positions when market opportunities arise.

#### DeFi Position Management
When managing complex DeFi positions:
- Quick rebalancing between wallets
- Emergency liquidation prevention transfers
- Profit taking without delay

### Special Situations

#### Estate Planning
Some users whitelist:
- Beneficiary addresses with clear documentation
- Trust wallet addresses
- Legal entity wallets for succession planning

#### Migration Scenarios
When upgrading wallet infrastructure:
- Whitelist new wallet before full migration
- Transfer assets in any size batches
- No risk of hitting limits during transition

### What NOT to Whitelist

Understanding what to avoid is equally important:

❌ **Exchange deposit addresses** - These can change
❌ **Service provider wallets** - Use Payees with limits instead
❌ **New acquaintances** - Trust must be absolute
❌ **Smart contracts** - Unless you fully understand them

### Best Practices

1. **Start Minimal**: Only whitelist what you absolutely need
2. **Document Purposes**: Keep records of why each address is whitelisted
3. **Regular Reviews**: Remove addresses no longer needed
4. **Test First**: Send small amounts before relying on whitelist
5. **Backup Access**: Ensure whitelisted addresses remain accessible

### The Cheque Exception

Remember: You cannot create Cheques for whitelisted addresses. This is by design—if an address has unlimited transfer access, there's no need for the controlled payment mechanism that Cheques provide. Use Cheques for recipients who need specific amounts at specific times, and use the Whitelist for addresses that need complete freedom.

The Whitelist is about removing friction where it matters most while maintaining security everywhere else.
