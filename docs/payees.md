# Payees: Automated Payment Relationships That Actually Work

Stop losing $400 monthly because your payroll sits in a checking account earning nothing. Stop paying $50 wire fees. Stop missing payments while traveling. Stop worrying about sending too much by accident.

**Payees** are pre-approved payment recipients with smart contract-enforced limits. Think automatic bill pay, but you keep earning yield until the moment of payment, you can cancel instantly, and you control every parameter.

This is what happens when you redesign payments from first principles — your money works harder, your operations run smoother, and you sleep better.

## Core Concept: Controlled Payment Relationships

Traditional payments force bad choices: manual processing (time-consuming) or full access (risky). Payees create a better way:

```
Traditional: Give vendor your credit card → They charge whatever, whenever
Underscore: Add vendor as Payee → $5,000/month limit → Only USDC → Auto-expires quarterly
```

### The Yield Advantage

Your payment funds earn yield until needed:

```
Traditional Business Account:
$100,000 payroll fund → 0.01% APY → $10/year

Underscore with Payees:
$100,000 in Aave → 5% APY → $5,000/year
Automatic withdrawal only when payments due
```

**Real impact**: A business with $500k in operating funds earns ~$25,000 annually instead of $50.

## Payment Validation Hierarchy

The system checks payment recipients in strict order:

1. **[Whitelisted Addresses](whitelist.md)** → Instant, no limits
2. **Owner (You)** → Can self-pay if enabled
3. **Active Payees** → All configured limits apply
4. **Others** → Payment blocked

This hierarchy maximizes flexibility while maintaining security.

## Two-Layer Control System

### Global Payee Settings

Wallet-wide defaults affecting all payees:

- Default period length (e.g., 30 days)
- Base transaction and period limits
- `canPayOwner`: Self-payment toggle
- `canPull`: Master switch for pull payments

### Specific Payee Settings

Individual overrides for each relationship:

- Custom limits tailored to each payee
- Specific period lengths
- Asset restrictions
- Pull payment permissions

The most restrictive setting always wins.

## Financial Controls

### Dual Limit System

Payees support both token amount AND USD value limits:

```
Token Limits:              USD Limits:
├─ Per Tx: 1000 USDC      ├─ Per Tx: $1,000
├─ Per Period: 5000 USDC  ├─ Per Period: $5,000
└─ Lifetime: 50000 USDC   └─ Lifetime: $50,000

Applied: MOST RESTRICTIVE wins
```

**Why both?** Protects against price volatility. Your 10 ETH payment won't accidentally send $40,000 if ETH spikes.

### Period-Based Limits

Limits reset automatically each period:

```
Month 1: Use $7k of $10k → Month 2: Fresh $10k (unused doesn't roll)
```

Common configurations:

- Daily: ~43,200 blocks
- Weekly: ~302,400 blocks
- Monthly: ~1,296,000 blocks
- Quarterly: ~3,888,000 blocks

### Transaction Controls

- **Max Transactions**: Limit payment frequency (e.g., 1/month for salary)
- **Cooldown Period**: Minimum time between payments (prevents double-pays)
- **Fail on Zero Price**: Blocks payments if price oracles fail

## Asset Restrictions

Control exactly what tokens each payee can receive:

| Setting                      | Effect               | Use Case            |
| ---------------------------- | -------------------- | ------------------- |
| Primary Asset + Only Primary | Single token only    | Salary in USDC only |
| Primary Asset + Any          | Preference indicated | Vendor prefers USDT |
| No Restrictions              | Accept anything      | Trading services    |

## Lifecycle Management

### Activation Flow

```
Added → Pending → Active → Expired/Removed
         (delay)   (working)
```

Typical delays:

- High-value vendor: 7 days
- New employee: 3 days
- Trusted family: 1 day
- Known partner: 1 hour

### Administrative Hierarchy

**Owner (You)**

- Direct add/update/remove
- Confirm manager proposals
- Full control always

**[Managers](managers.md)**

- Propose new payees only
- Requires owner confirmation
- Cannot modify/remove

**Payees**

- Can remove themselves
- Enables clean exits

**Security (MissionControl)**

- Emergency removal only
- Protocol safety net

## Pull Payments: The Subscription Revolution

Enable payees to request payment when due — within your limits.

### How It Works

1. Service requests payment amount
2. Smart contract validates against limits
3. Funds pulled from yield if needed (like [cheques](cheques.md))
4. Payment completes automatically

### Double Activation Required

```
Global: canPull = true  AND  Payee: canPull = true
                ↓
        Pull payments enabled
```

### Real Numbers

Traditional subscriptions:

- $500/month sitting idle = $0 earned

With pull payments:

- $500/month earning 5% = $25/year extra
- $6,000 annual subscriptions = $300/year bonus

**Safety**: Pull payees MUST have limits. No unlimited access allowed.

## Common Questions

**What happens at expiry?**
Payees automatically deactivate. Payments blocked until you renew.

**Can payees see my balance?**
No. They can only receive what you've authorized.

**What if I overpay by mistake?**
Impossible. Hard limits prevent sending more than configured.

**Do I need separate payees for each employee?**
Yes. Each payee has individual limits and tracking.

**Can I modify limits after setup?**
Yes. Changes take effect immediately.

## The Bottom Line

Every dollar sitting in a business checking account is a dollar not earning yield. Every manual payment is time wasted. Every wire fee is money burned.

Payees fix all three problems simultaneously. Your funds earn until needed. Payments execute automatically within your rules. Minimal gas costs replace expensive wire fees.

For a typical small business: Save $10,000+ annually in fees and lost yield. Reclaim 10 hours monthly from payment processing. Sleep knowing payments can't exceed your limits.

Stop choosing between convenience and control. With Payees, you get both — plus yield that pays for your Netflix subscription 10 times over.
