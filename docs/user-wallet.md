# User Wallet: Your Financial Command Center, Reimagined

**TL;DR:**
- One smart wallet that connects to every DeFi protocol automatically
- Built-in security tools: managers, payees, cheques, and whitelist for emergency access
- Reduce gas costs while earning yield 24/7 through intelligent automation
- Instant freeze and rescue capabilities if something goes wrong

Your current crypto wallet is like a safe with no tools inside. It holds your assets but can't do much else. You switch between 10 different apps to manage DeFi. You miss yield opportunities while sleeping. You pay more gas than necessary. And one wrong click could drain everything.

The **Underscore User Wallet** changes all of this. It's not just a wallet — it's an intelligent financial operating system that manages complexity while you maintain control. One address. Every protocol. Total security. Maximum efficiency.

This is what happens when you rebuild crypto wallets from first principles.

## Core Architecture: Security Through Layers

Your User Wallet implements institutional-grade security without institutional complexity:

```
Your Control Center
├─ Owner (You): Complete authority, can freeze everything instantly
├─ Whitelist: Your trusted addresses with unlimited access
├─ Managers: Delegated operators with specific limits
├─ Payees: Pre-approved recipients with payment caps
└─ Everyone Else: Zero access
```

Each layer serves a purpose. Each permission has boundaries. Every action leaves an audit trail.

**How are these rules enforced?** Every transaction passes through Sentinel, our automated security engine that blocks anything outside your configured limits. It's like having a vigilant guard who never sleeps, checking every action against your rules before allowing it to proceed.

## The Power of Legos: One Wallet, Every Protocol

Legos are standardized DeFi integrations that give your wallet superpowers:

```
Your Wallet → LegoTools (Router) → Lego Adapters → 20+ DeFi Protocols
```

**What this means**: When Morpho launches with better rates than Aave, your wallet can use it immediately. When new DEXs offer better prices, you access them automatically. No upgrades. No migrations. No new interfaces to learn.

**Why you can trust Legos**: Every Lego integration is open-source, audited, and runs in a sandboxed environment with limited permissions. They can only perform specific actions you've authorized — never more.

**Currently integrated**: 
- 6 yield protocols (Aave, Morpho, Compound, more)
- 8+ DEX protocols (Uniswap, Curve, Aerodrome, more)
- Lending, liquidity, and specialized protocols

Your wallet gets more powerful over time, not obsolete.

## Built-In Security Tools

### [Managers](managers.md): Your Automated Operators

Delegate specific operations to humans or AI with precise controls:

**Example AI Yield Manager**:
- Daily limit: $10,000
- Monthly cap: $100,000
- Permissions: Yield optimization only
- Result: Higher yields through 24/7 rebalancing
- Activation: 3-day security delay

Managers can execute complex strategies within your boundaries. Revoke access instantly if needed. Learn more about [setting up managers](managers.md).

### [Payees](payees.md): Streamlined Payment Rails

Pre-approved addresses that can receive funds within defined limits:

**Example Employee Setup**:
- Monthly salary: $5,000 USDC
- Period: 30 days
- Transactions: 2 per month (bi-weekly)
- Result: Automated payroll, zero wire fees

Your funds earn yield until payment moment. Traditional payroll: $50 fees + lost yield. Discover how to [configure payees](payees.md) for your business.

### [Cheques](cheques.md): Payments with an Undo Button

Time-locked payment promises you control until cashed:

```
Create $10,000 cheque → 3-day security delay → Recipient can claim
Cancel anytime before claimed → Funds never left wallet
```

Perfect for invoices, rent, or any payment needing review time. See how [cheques work](cheques.md) in detail.

### [Whitelist](whitelist.md): VIP Access

Your most trusted addresses (hardware wallet, treasury) with unlimited transfer rights:
- No limits or delays
- 3-7 day security period to add
- Instant removal if compromised
- Typically 2-5 addresses maximum

## DeFi Operations: Complexity Made Simple

### Yield Farming
- **Traditional**: 3 transactions, higher gas costs, manual tracking
- **Underscore**: 1 transaction, optimized gas usage, automatic profit calculation
- **Benefit**: Significant gas reduction + perfect accounting

Your wallet tracks yield across all positions, calculates profits automatically, and enables single-transaction rebalancing.

### Token Swaps
Execute complex routes in one transaction:
```
USDC → ETH → wstETH (wrapped staked ETH)
Maximum 5 hops for best rates
One transaction instead of three separate swaps
```

### Liquidity Provision
Add/remove liquidity with automatic position tracking:
- Standard pools: Lower gas costs
- Concentrated liquidity: Uniswap V3 positions with higher gas costs
- Impermanent loss calculations included

### Borrowing & Lending
Manage collateralized positions safely:
- Real-time health monitoring
- Multi-protocol support
- Efficient collateral management
- Liquidation protection features

## Common Questions

**Is my wallet upgradeable?**
No. Your wallet code is immutable for security. New features come through Lego integrations.

**What if a Lego is compromised?**
Legos have limited permissions. Your security settings always apply. Remove access instantly if needed.

**Can I use multiple wallets?**
Yes. Whitelist them for instant transfers between your wallets.

**What about L2s?**
We're live on Base L2! This gives you the same security as Ethereum with much lower transaction costs.

**How do fees work?**
Protocol fees apply only on profitable activities:
- Yield optimization: 10% of profits (never more than 25%)
- Token swaps: 0.1-0.5% per trade
- No fees on losses, transfers, or idle funds

## The Bottom Line

Every other wallet makes you choose between security and functionality. The Underscore User Wallet delivers both.

One address that connects to every protocol. Security layers that protect without restricting. Automation that works while you sleep. Gas savings that pay for themselves. This isn't an incremental improvement — it's a fundamental rethinking of what a wallet should be.

> **Risks & Responsibilities**: DeFi involves smart contract risk, market volatility, and potential oracle failures. While we've implemented multiple security layers and audit our code, no system is risk-free. Always start with small amounts, understand the protocols you're using, and never invest more than you can afford to lose.

Your money. Your control. Every protocol. Maximum efficiency.

Welcome to the future of DeFi. It's already here.
