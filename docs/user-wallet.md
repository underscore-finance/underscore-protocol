# User Wallet: Your Financial Command Center, Reimagined

**TL;DR:**
- One smart wallet that connects to every DeFi protocol automatically
- Built-in security tools: managers, payees, cheques, and whitelist
- Reduce gas costs while earning yield 24/7 through intelligent automation

Your current crypto wallet is like a safe with no tools inside. It holds your assets but can't do much else. You switch between 10 different apps to manage DeFi. You miss yield opportunities while sleeping. You pay 40% more gas than necessary. And one wrong click could drain everything.

The **Underscore User Wallet** changes all of this. It's not just a wallet — it's an intelligent financial operating system that manages complexity while you maintain control. One address. Every protocol. Total security. Maximum efficiency.

This is what happens when you rebuild crypto wallets from first principles.

## Core Architecture: Security Through Layers

Your User Wallet implements institutional-grade security without institutional complexity:

```
Your Control Center
├─ Owner (You): Complete authority, can freeze everything instantly
├─ Whitelist: Your trusted addresses with unlimited access
├─ Managers: Delegated operators with specific limits
├─ Payees: Pre-approved recipients with payment caps
└─ Everyone Else: Zero access
```

Each layer serves a purpose. Each permission has boundaries. Every action leaves an audit trail.

## The Power of Legos: One Wallet, Every Protocol

Legos are standardized DeFi integrations that give your wallet superpowers:

```
Your Wallet → LegoTools (Router) → Lego Adapters → 20+ DeFi Protocols
```

**What this means**: When Morpho launches with better rates than Aave, your wallet can use it immediately. When new DEXs offer better prices, you access them automatically. No upgrades. No migrations. No new interfaces to learn.

**Currently integrated**: 
- 6 yield protocols (Aave, Morpho, Compound, more)
- 8+ DEX protocols (Uniswap, Curve, Aerodrome, more)
- Lending, liquidity, and specialized protocols

Your wallet gets more powerful over time, not obsolete.

## Built-In Security Tools

### [Managers](managers.md): Your Automated Operators

Delegate specific operations to humans or AI with precise controls:

**Example AI Yield Manager**:
```
Daily limit: $10,000
Monthly cap: $100,000
Permissions: Yield optimization only
Result: +2-3% APY through 24/7 rebalancing
Activation: 3-day security delay
```

Managers can execute complex strategies within your boundaries. Revoke access instantly if needed. Learn more about [setting up managers](managers.md).

### [Payees](payees.md): Streamlined Payment Rails

Pre-approved addresses that can receive funds within defined limits:

**Example Employee Setup**:
```
Monthly salary: $5,000 USDC
Period: 30 days
Transactions: 2 per month (bi-weekly)
Result: Automated payroll, zero wire fees
```

Your funds earn yield until payment moment. Traditional payroll: $50 fees + lost yield. Discover how to [configure payees](payees.md) for your business.

### [Cheques](cheques.md): Payments with an Undo Button

Time-locked payment promises you control until cashed:

```
Create $10,000 cheque → 3-day security delay → Recipient can claim
Cancel anytime before claimed → Funds never left wallet
```

Perfect for invoices, rent, or any payment needing review time. See how [cheques work](cheques.md) in detail.

### [Whitelist](whitelist.md): VIP Access

Your most trusted addresses (hardware wallet, treasury) with unlimited transfer rights:
- No limits or delays
- 3-7 day security period to add
- Instant removal if compromised
- Typically 2-5 addresses maximum

## DeFi Operations: Complexity Made Simple

### Yield Farming
```
Traditional: 3 transactions, higher gas costs, manual tracking
Underscore: 1 transaction, optimized gas usage, automatic profit calculation
Savings: Significant gas reduction + perfect accounting
```

Your wallet tracks yield across all positions, calculates profits automatically, and enables single-transaction rebalancing.

### Token Swaps
Execute complex routes in one transaction:
```
USDC → ETH → wstETH
Maximum 5 hops for best rates
Save 30-50% on gas vs separate swaps
```

### Liquidity Provision
Add/remove liquidity with automatic position tracking:
- Standard pools: Lower gas costs
- Concentrated liquidity: Higher gas costs with NFT management
- Impermanent loss calculations included

### Borrowing & Lending
Manage collateralized positions safely:
- Real-time health monitoring
- Multi-protocol support
- Efficient collateral management
- Liquidation protection features

## Common Questions

**Is my wallet upgradeable?**
No. Your wallet code is immutable for security. New features come through Lego integrations.

**What if a Lego is compromised?**
Legos have limited permissions. Your security settings always apply. Remove access instantly if needed.

**Can I use multiple wallets?**
Yes. Whitelist them for instant transfers between your wallets.

**What about L2s?**
Currently mainnet only. L2 support planned.

**How do fees work?**
Small fees (0-5%) on profits only. No fees on losses or transfers.

## The Bottom Line

Every other wallet makes you choose between security and functionality. The Underscore User Wallet delivers both.

One address that connects to every protocol. Security layers that protect without restricting. Automation that works while you sleep. Gas savings that pay for themselves. This isn't an incremental improvement — it's a fundamental rethinking of what a wallet should be.

Your money. Your control. Every protocol. Maximum efficiency.

Welcome to the future of DeFi. It's already here.
